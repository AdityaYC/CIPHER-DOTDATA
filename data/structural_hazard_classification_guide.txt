RED (No entry)
- Imminent collapse risk: severe tilt, major cracks, partial collapse.
- Unstable overhangs, pancaked floors, or heavy debris load.

Assessment checklist
- Foundation: shifting, settlement, cracks.
- Load-bearing walls: bowing, rotation, missing sections.
- Floors/roof: sagging, holes, partial collapse.
- Secondary hazards: gas, water, electrical, hazmat.
- Environmental: weather, aftershocks, fire.

Reassessment after any event (aftershock, weather, heavy machinery).
