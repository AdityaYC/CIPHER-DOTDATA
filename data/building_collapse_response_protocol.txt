BUILDING COLLAPSE RESPONSE PROTOCOL

1. Immediate actions
   - Establish safe perimeter; do not enter structurally unsound areas.
   - Call emergency services and report location, number of occupants if known.
   - Identify potential secondary collapse zones (overhangs, unstable walls).

2. Search and triage
   - Use systematic search patterns (grid or sector).
   - Mark entry points and hazards (red/yellow/green tape if available).
   - Triage: immediate (airway/bleeding), delayed, minor, deceased. Tag and document.

3. Survivor extraction
   - Stabilize the space (shoring, cribbing) before extraction when possible.
   - Avoid moving spine-injured persons unless in immediate danger.
   - Use blankets or stretchers for transport; log time and handoff to EMS.

4. Structural hazard classification
   - Green: safe to work. Yellow: caution, limited time. Red: no entry.
   - Reassess after aftershocks or weather changes.

5. Equipment
   - Helmet, gloves, boots, dust mask minimum. Hearing protection near machinery.
   - Radios for team coordination; do not rely on cell networks.
