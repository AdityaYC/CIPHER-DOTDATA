SURVIVOR EXTRACTION PROCEDURES

1. Assessment
   - Check for responsiveness, airway, breathing, major bleeding.
   - Note suspected fractures or spinal injury; minimize movement if spine at risk.
   - Document condition and time of find for handoff.

2. Safe access
   - Clear debris from path; do not pull on limbs to free.
   - If pinned, stabilize the object or get specialized rescue before heavy lifting.
   - Protect survivor from further collapse (e.g. helmet, covering).

3. Extraction techniques
   - Blanket drag: roll onto blanket, pull from head end.
   - Two-person carry: support head/neck and hips; keep spine in line.
   - Chair carry only if no spinal concern and survivor can sit.

4. After extraction
   - Move to casualty collection point; keep warm and calm.
   - Re-triage; hand off to EMS with written or verbal report.
   - Do not give food or water if abdominal injury or altered consciousness suspected.

5. Team safety
   - Rotate rescuers; watch for fatigue and dehydration.
   - Evacuate if structure becomes unstable or air quality worsens.
