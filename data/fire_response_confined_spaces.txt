FIRE RESPONSE IN CONFINED SPACES

1. Size-up
   - Identify fuel, ventilation, and escape routes.
   - Confined space = limited oxygen; risk of backdraft and flashover.
   - Do not open doors until charged hose line and PPE ready.

2. Ventilation
   - Vent from top when possible to release heat and smoke.
   - Coordinate with attack team; avoid wind-driven spread.
   - If entry required, use positive-pressure ventilation toward exit.

3. Attack
   - Stay low; use thermal imaging if available.
   - Apply water in short bursts to cool; avoid steam production.
   - Protect egress; do not advance beyond safe withdrawal time.

4. Rescue
   - Locate occupants quickly; drag or carry low.
   - If no visibility, search along walls; use rope or tag line.
   - Account for all personnel at rally point.

5. Safety
   - SCBA and PASS devices mandatory in IDLH.
   - Two-out rule: two responders outside ready to rescue entry team.
   - Evacuate immediately on unexpected structural failure or flashover signs.
